# VShadeLoadingScreen
VShadeLoadingScreen is a simple and practical demonstration of the [VShade library](https://github.com/basdxz/VShade).
It showcases the replacement of the Minecraft 1.7.10 loading screen with a real-time shader, primarily serving as an API-use example.

## Attribution
The original shader was created and shared on [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsVfz1) by Shane.
 It was later modified by [SirFell](https://github.com/SirFell) and used in the MEGA modpack for a period of time.
